## Motivation

Animation graphs are an essential tool for managing the complexity present in
the animation pipelines for modern 3D games. When your game has tens of
animations with complex blends and transitions, or you want to generate
your animations procedurally from very few keyframes, simple animation
clip playback is not enough.

This library aims to fill this gap in the Bevy ecosystem.
